about your actual task : python has to look up into the tab so it is searching tabs starting by Appels- 
Then select phone number 9 digits after Appels- and see if it matches with a 9 digit in column E of the other file
if matches so export data
if not match, skip to other tab
when it finish to lookup each tab it has to write previous month and year on col B 
Total reçus : 3 = colAA 
4min20sec = colAC ( but just send the number that is before min = 4, if there is no min, we have to send 0) 
Total émis = 0 = colAE
Total emis = 0sec = colAG = send 0 (just send the number that is before min = 0), if there is no min, we have to send 0 




No, the procedure of call log track will be slightly different, the parent class should be there for authentication, file accessing and others. I am telling you the task, 
there are two google sheets file,  1. customer info file, 2. master call log sending file. 
the code will do the following,
1. it will search in the master call log, and look for tabs that start with "Appels-", after "Apples-" it will have a 9 digit number this is an identifier, 
2. it will form a dictionary with key of that number
3. then it will get a data from the tab which is located at the 3rd and 4 th row from the last and 2nd to 4th column.
4. it will collect that data from all the "Apples-" tab
5. then it will go to custemer info file, then look up for the 9 digit numbers, if matches it will edit  certain columns, say column, 68, 78, 97, 37, 33, 99 insert that data, and edit column B to have the date with previous month
